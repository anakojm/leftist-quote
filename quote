\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m History does nothing; it does not possess immense riches, it does not fight battles. It is men, real, living, who do all this.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The worker of the world has nothing to lose, but their chains, workers of the world unite.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of communism.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m We should not say that one man’s hour is worth another man’s hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing: he is at the most time’s carcass.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m There is a specter haunting Europe, the specter of Communism.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m In a higher phase of communist society... only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m A commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m It is not history which uses men as a means of achieving - as if it were an individual person - its own ends. History is nothing but the activity of men in pursuit of their ends.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialized labor.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m For the bureaucrat, the world is a mere object to be manipulated by him.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The English have all the material requisites for the revolution. What they lack is the spirit of generalization and revolutionary ardour.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The development of civilization and industry in general has always shown itself so active in the destruction of forests that everything that has been done for their conservation and production is completely insignificant in comparison.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece, but he cannot of course create it.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m It is absolutely impossible to transcend the laws of nature. What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws expose themselves.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m On a level plain, simple mounds look like hills; and the insipid flatness of our present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects.\033[0m\\n- Karl Marx\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Competition is the law of the jungle, but cooperation is the law of civilization\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The hopeless don’t revolt, because revolution is an act of hope.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Where there is authority, there is no freedom.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Everywhere you will find that the wealth of the wealthy springs from the poverty of the poor.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The law has no claim to human respect. It has no civilizing mission; its only purpose is to protect exploitation.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m America is just the country that shows how all the written guarantees in the world for freedom are no protection against tyranny and oppression of the worst kind. There the politician has come to be looked upon as the very scum of society.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Think about the world you want to live and work in. What do you need to know to build the world? Demand that your teachers teach you that.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotki\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement - at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist. Only, instead of demanding that those social customs should be maintained through the authority of a few, it demands it from the continued action of all.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Idlers do not make history: they suffer it!\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Freedom of the press, freedom of association, the inviolability of domicile, and all the rest of the rights of man are respected so long as no one tries to use them against the privileged class. On the day they are launched against the privileged they are overthrown.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m It is only those who do nothing who makes no mistake.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m All is for all! If the man and the woman bear their fair share of work, they have a right to their fair share of all that is produced by all, and that share is enough to secure them well-being. No more of such vague formulas as \"The Right to work,\" or \"To each the whole result of his labour.\" What we proclaim is The Right to Well-Being: Well-Being for All!\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Prisons are universities of crime, maintained by the state.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m When we ask for the abolition of the State and its organs we are always told that we dream of a society composed of men better than they are in reality. But no; a thousand times, no. All we ask is that men should not be made worse than they are, by such institutions!\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Struggle so that all may live this rich, overflowing life. And be sure that in this struggle you will find a joy greater than anything else can give.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m True progress lies in the direction of decentralization, both territorial and functional, in the development of the spirit of local and personal initiative, and of free federation from the simple to the compound, in lieu of the present hierarchy from the centre to the periphery.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The education we all receive from the State, at school and after, has so warped our minds that the very notion of freedom ends up by being lost, and disguised in servitude. It is a sad sight to see those who believe themselves to be revolutionaries unleashing their hatred on the anarchist just because his views on freedom go beyond their petty and narrow concepts of freedom learned in the State school.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Lenin is not comparable to any revolutionary figure in history. Revolutionaries have had ideals. Lenin has none.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Poverty, the existence of the poor, was the first cause of riches.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m When one has talent, everything contributes to its development.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Man is appealed to be guided in his acts, not merely by love, which is always personal, or at best tribal, but by his perception of his oneness with each human being. In the practice of mutual aid, which we can re-trace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support- not mutual struggle- has had the leading part.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Revolutions, we must remember, are always made by minorities.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Each individual is a cosmos of organs, each organ is a cosmos of cells, each cell is a cosmos of infinitely small ones; and in this complex world, the well-being of the whole depends entirely on the sum of well-being enjoyed by each of the least microscopic particles of organized matter. A whole revolution is thus produced in the philosophy of life.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Men passionately desire to live after death, but they often pass away without noticing the fact that the memory of a really good person always lives. It is impressed upon the next generation, and is transmitted again to the children. Is that not an immortality worth striving for?\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m It is often said that Anarchists live in a world of dreams to come, and do not see the things which happen today. We do see them only too well, and in their true colors, and that is what makes us carry the hatchet into the forest of prejudice that besets us.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The State calls its own violence, law; but that of the individual, crime.\033[0m\\n- Max Stirner\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Whoever will be free must make himself free. Freedom is no fairy gift to fall into a man’s lap. What is freedom? To have the will to be responsible for one’s self.\033[0m\\n- Max Stirner\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The State has always one purpose: to limit, control, subordinate the individual and subject him to the general purpose Through its censorship, its supervision, and its police the State tries to obstruct all free activity and sees this repression as its duty, because the instinct of self-preservation demands it. The State does not permit me to use my thoughts to their full value and communicate them to other men unless they are its own Otherwise it shuts me up.\033[0m\\n- Max Stirner\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Freedom cannot be granted. It must be taken.\033[0m\\n- Max Stirner\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Whoever is a complete person does not need to be an authority.\033[0m\\n- Max Stirner\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m If it is right for me, it is right. It is possible that it is wrong for others: let them take care of themselves!\033[0m\\n- Max Stirner\n

It is a machine that crushes you in order to sustain the ruling class, your masters. Like naïve children you put your trust in your political leaders. You make it possible for them to creep into your confidence, only to have them betray you to the first bidder. But even where there is no direct betrayal, the labour politicians make common cause with your enemies to keep you in leash, to prevent your direct action. The State is the pillar of capitalism, and it is ridiculous to expect any redress from it.\033[0m\\n- Emma Goldman\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The most absurd apology for authority and law is that they serve to diminish crime. Aside from the fact that the State is itself the greatest criminal, breaking every written and natural law, stealing in the form of taxes, killing in the form of war and capital punishment, it has come to an absolute standstill in coping with crime. It has failed utterly to destroy or even minimize the horrible scourge of its own creation.\033[0m\\n- Emma Goldman\n

It is of insurmountable strength against the individual, and is his necessity and the power oppressing him. And the strength that each one has in his being-recognized is that of a people. This strength, however, is effective only insofar as it is united into a unity, only as will.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Jena Lectures of 1805-6\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The bud disappears when the blossom breaks through, and we might say that the former is refuted by the latter; in the same way when the fruit comes, the blossom may be explained to be a false form of the plant’s existence, for the fruit appears as its true nature in place of the blossom. The ceaseless activity of their own inherent nature makes these stages moments of an organic unity, where they not merely do not contradict one another, but where one is as necessary as the other; and constitutes thereby the life of the whole.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Our epoch is a birth-time, and a period of transition. The spirit of man has broken with the old order of things hitherto prevailing, and with the old ways of thinking, and is in the mind to let them all sink into the depths of the past and to set about its own transformation.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m A building is not finished when its foundation is laid; and just as little, is the attainment of a general notion of a whole the whole itself. When we want to see an oak, we are not satisfied to be shown an acorn instead. In the same way science, the crowning glory of a spiritual world, is not found complete in its initial stages.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m To pit this single assertion, that “in the Absolute all is one,” against the organised whole of determinate and complete knowledge, or of knowledge which at least aims at and demands complete development – to give out its Absolute as the night in which, as we say, all cows are black – that is the very naïveté of emptiness of knowledge.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m If we say ‘all animals’, that does not pass for zoology; for the same reason we see at once that the words absolute, divine, eternal, and so on do not express what is implied in them.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The particular individual, so far as content is concerned, has also to go through the stages through which the general mind has passed, but as shapes once assumed by mind and now laid aside, as stages of a road which has been worked over and levelled out. Hence it is that, in the case of various kinds of knowledge, we find that what in former days occupied the energies of men of mature mental ability sinks to the level of information, exercises, and even pastimes, for children; and in this educational progress we can see the history of the world’s culture delineated in faint outline. This bygone mode of existence has already become an acquired possession of the general mind, which constitutes the substance of the individual, and, by thus appearing externally to him, furnishes his inorganic nature. In this respect culture or development of mind (Bildung), regarded from the side of the individual, consists in his acquiring what lies at his hand ready for him, in making its inorganic nature organic to himself, and taking possession of it for himself. Looked at, however, from the side of universal mind qua general spiritual substance, culture means nothing else than that this substance gives itself its own self-consciousness, brings about its own inherent process and its own reflection into self.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807)\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Philosophy, if it would be a science, cannot borrow its method from a subordinate science like mathematics.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Reason is negative and dialectical, because it resolves the determinations of the understanding into nothing.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The development of all natural and spiritual life rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialities which constitute the content of logic.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m It is this self-construing method alone which enables philosophy to be an objective, demonstrated science. It is in this way that I have tried to expound consciousness in the Phenomenology of Spirit. Consciousness is spirit as a concrete knowing, a knowing too, in which externality is involved; but the development of this object, like the development of all natural and spiritual life, rests solely on the nature of the pure essentialities which constitute the content of logic.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Preface to The Science of Logic (1812)\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Dialectic is here understood in the grasping of opposites in their unity or of the positive in the negative.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Logic, like grammar, appears in two different aspects or values. It is one thing for him who comes to it for the first time, but it is another thing for him who comes back to it from the sciences. He who begins the study of grammar finds in its forms and laws dry abstractions, arbitrary rules. On the other hand, he who has mastered a language and at the same time has a comparative knowledge of other languages, he alone can make contact with the spirit and culture of a people through the grammar of its language. Similarly, he who approaches this science at first finds in logic an isolated system of abstractions which, confined within itself, does not embrace within its scope the other knowledges and sciences.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m It is only after profounder acquaintance with the other sciences that logic ceases to be for subjective spirit a merely abstract universal and reveals itself as the universal which embraces within itself the wealth of the particular – just as the same proverb, in the mouth of a youth who understands it quite well, does not possess the wide range of meaning which it has in the mind of a man with the experience of a lifetime behind him, for who, the meaning is expressed in all its power.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, The Science of Logic (1812)\n

The world spirit, this essential, proceeds irresistibly like a closely drawn armored phalanx advancing with imperceptible movement, much as the sun through thick and thin. Innumerable light troops flank it on all sides, throwing themselves into the balance for or against its progress, though most of them are entirely ignorant of what is at stake and merely take head blows as from an invisible hand.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Letter to Niethammer, 5 July 1816\n

Links of this chain are the individual sciences [of logic, nature and spirit], each of which has an antecedent and a successor – or, expressed more accurately, has only the antecedent and indicates its successor in its conclusion.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, The Science of Logic (1816)\n

In each of these parts, however, the philosophical Idea is found in a particular specificality or medium. The single circle, because it is a real totality, bursts through the limits imposed by its special medium, and gives rise to a wider circle. The whole of philosophy in this way resembles a circle of circles.

The fact is, no man can think for another, any more than he can eat or drink for him. In point of contents, thought is only true in proportion as it sinks itself in the facts; and in point of form it is no private act of the subject, but rather that attitude of consciousness where the abstract self, freed from all the special limitations to which its ordinary states are liable, restricts itself to that universal action in which it is identical with all individuals.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m In my Phenomenology of the Spirit, which on that account was at its publication described as the first part of the System of Philosophy, the method adopted was to begin with the first and simplest phase of mind, immediate consciousness, and to show how that stage gradually of necessity worked onward to the philosophical point of view, the necessity of that view being proved by the process. But in these circumstances it was impossible to restrict the quest to the mere form of consciousness. For the stage of philosophical knowledge is the richest in material and organisation, and therefore, as it came before us in the shape of a result, it presupposed the existence of the concrete formations of consciousness, such as individual and social morality, art and religion. In the development of consciousness, which at first sight appears limited to the point of form merely, there is thus at the same time included the development of the matter or of the objects discussed in the special branches of philosophy. But the latter process must, so to speak, go on behind consciousness, since those facts are the essential nucleus which is raised into consciousness. The exposition accordingly is rendered more intricate, because so much that properly belongs to the concrete branches is prematurely dragged into the introduction. The survey which follows in the present work has even more the inconvenience of being only historical and inferential in its method. But it tries especially to show how the questions men have proposed, outside the school, on the nature of Knowledge, Faith, and the like - questions which they imagine to have no connection with abstract thoughts - are really reducible to the simple categories, which first get cleared up in Logic.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.

As the logical Idea is seen to unfold itself in a process from the abstract to the concrete, so in the history of philosophy the earliest systems are the most abstract, and thus at the same time the poorest. The relation too of the earlier to the later systems of philosophy is much like the relation of the corresponding stages of the logical Idea: in other words, the earlier are preserved in the later: but subordinated and submerged. This is the true meaning of a much misunderstood phenomenon in the history of philosophy – the refutation of one system by another, of an earlier by a later. Most commonly the refutation is taken in a purely negative sense to mean that the system refuted has ceased to count for anything, has been set aside and done for. Were it so, the history of philosophy would be, of all studies, most saddening, displaying, as it does, the refutation of every system which time has brought forth. Now although it may be admitted that every philosophy has been refuted, it must be in an equal degree maintained that no philosophy has been refuted. And that in two ways. For first, every philosophy that deserves the name always embodies the Idea: and secondly, every system represents one particular factor or particular stage in the evolution of the Idea. The refutation of a philosophy, therefore, only means that its barriers are crossed, and its special principle reduced to a factor in the completer principle that follows.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Shorter Logic (1830)\n

The notion is what contains all the earlier categories of thought merged in it, an infinite and creative form which includes, but at the same time releases from itself, the fullness of all content. And so too the notion may, if it be wished, be styled abstract, if the name concrete is restricted to the concrete facts of sense or of immediate perception. For the notion is not palpable to the touch, and when we are engaged with it, hearing and seeing must quite fail us. And yet, the notion is a true concrete.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Shorter Logic (1830)\n

Rousseau would have made a sounder contribution towards a theory of the state if he had always kept this distinction in sight.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Shorter Logic (1830)\n
\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m The notion is what is mediated through itself and with itself. It is a mistake to imagine that the objects which form the content of our mental ideas come first and that our subjective agency then supervenes, and by the aforesaid operation of abstraction, and by colligating the points possessed in common by the objects, frames notions of them. Rather the notion is the genuine first; and things are what they are through the action of the notion, immanent in them, and revealing itself in them.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Shorter Logic (1830)\n

Such, for example, is the case with the three branches of philosophy: the Logical Idea, Nature, and Mind. As we first see them, Nature is the middle term which links the others together. Nature, the totality immediately before us, unfolds itself into the two extremes of the Logical Idea and Mind. But Mind is Mind only when it is mediated through nature. Then, in the second place, Mind, which we know as the principle of individuality, or as the actualising principle, is the mean; and Nature and the Logical Idea are the extremes. It is Mind which cognises the Logical Idea in Nature and which thus raises Nature to its essence. In the third place again the Logical Idea itself becomes the mean: it is the absolute substance both of mind and of nature, the universal and all-pervading principle.\033[0m\\n- Hegel, Shorter Logic (1830)\n

Generally speaking, this is the man’s way of looking; while the young imagine that the world is utterly sunk in wickedness, and that the first thing needful is a thorough transformation.

This is why capital is productive; i.e. an essential relation for the development of the social productive forces. It ceases to exist as such only where the development of these productive forces themselves encounters its barrier in capital itself.\033[0m\\n- Marx, 1The Grundrisse (1857)\n

Marx had not only arrived at the same view, but had already, in the Deutsche-Französische Jahrbücher (1844), generalized it to the effect that, speaking generally, it is not the state which conditions and regulates the civil society at all, but civil society which conditions and regulates the state, and, consequently, that policy and its history are to be explained from the economic relations and their development, and not vice versa.\033[0m\\n- Engels, On the History of the Communist League (1885)\n

Freedom in this field can only consist in socialised man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis.

Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the material social structure. Marxism examines the class structure of society as a historically conditioned form of the development of the productive forces; Marxism deduces from the productive forces of society the inter-relations between human society and surrounding nature, and these, in turn are determined at each historical stage by man’s technology, his instruments and weapons, his capacities and methods for struggle with nature.

Socialization of family housekeeping and public education of children are unthinkable without a marked improvement in our economics as a whole. We need more socialist economic forms. Only under such conditions can we free the family from the functions and cares that now oppress and disintegrate it. Washing must be done by a public laundry, catering by a public restaurant, sewing by a public workshop. Children must be educated by good public teachers who have a real vocation for the work. Then the bond between husband and wife would be freed from everything external and accidental, and the one would cease to absorb the life of the other.

But in the relations of husband and wife, parents and children, in the domestic life of the family, fenced off from the whole world, Rasteryaevism is still firmly implanted.

The co-ordination of the mass insurrection with the conspiracy, the subordination of the conspiracy to the insurrection, the organisation of the insurrection through the conspiracy, constitutes that complex and responsible department of revolutionary politics which Marx and Engels called “the art of insurrection.” It presupposes a correct general leadership of the masses, a flexible orientation in changing conditions, a thought-out plan of attack, cautiousness in technical preparation, and a daring blow.\033[0m\\n- Trotsky, History of the Russian Revolution, Chpter 30 (1930)\n

Within the working class, it creates its own institutions, or utilizes those already existing, in order to oppose certain strata of workers to others. Within the proletariat several parties are active at the same time. Therefore, for the greater part of its historical journey, it remains split politically. The problem of the united front – which arises during certain periods most sharply originates therein. The historical interests of the proletariat find their expression in the Communist Party – when its policies are correct. The task of the Communist Party consists in winning over the majority of the proletariat; and only thus is the socialist revolution made possible.

Its upper stratum is linked directly to the big bourgeoisie. Its lower stratum merges with the proletariat and even falls to the status of lumpen proletariat.

The Fourth International does not discard the program of the old “minimal” demands to the degree to which these have preserved at least part of their vital forcefulness. Indefatigably, it defends the democratic rights and social conquests of the workers. But it carries on this day-to-day work within the framework of the correct actual, that is, revolutionary perspective. Insofar as the old, partial, “minimal” demands of the masses clash with the destructive and degrading tendencies of decadent capitalism - and this occurs at each step-the Fourth International advances a system of transitional demands, the essence of which is contained in the fact that ever more openly and decisively they will be directed against the very bases of the bourgeois regime. The old “minimal program” is superseded by the transitional program, the task of which lies in systematic mobilization of the masses for the proletarian revolution.\033[0m\\n- The Fourth International does not discard the program of the old “minimal” demands to the degree to which these have preserved at least part of their vital forcefulness.

We maintain on the contrary that all moral theories have been hitherto the product, in the last analysis, of the economic conditions of society obtaining at the time. And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms, morality has always been class morality; it has either justified the domination and the interests of the ruling class, or ever since the oppressed class became powerful enough, it has represented its indignation against this domination and the future interests of the oppressed. That in this process there has on the whole been progress in morality, as in all other branches of human knowledge, no one will doubt.

By this act, the proletariat frees the means of production from the character of capital they have thus far borne, and gives their socialized character complete freedom to work itself out. Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master – free.To accomplish this act of universal emancipation is the historical mission of the modern proletariat.

Those who toil and live in want all their lives are taught by religion to be submissive and patient while here on earth, and to take comfort in the hope of a heavenly reward. But those who live by the labour of others are taught by religion to practise charity while on earth, thus offering them a very cheap way of justifying their entire existence as exploiters and selling them at a moderate price tickets to well-being in heaven.

Everyone knows that the reason is by no means because the factory owners wish to feed the hungry workers, but because they wish to extract profit from them. For the sake of profit, the factory owner builds his factory; for the sake of profit, he engages workers; for the sake of profit, he is always nosing out where higher prices are paid. Profit is the motive of all his calculations. Herein, moreover, we discern a very interesting characteristic of capitalist society. For society does not itself produce the things which are necessary and useful to it; instead of this, the capitalist class compels the workers to produce those things for which more will be paid, those things from which the capitalists derive the largest profit. Whisky, for example, is a very harmful substance, and alcoholic liquors in general ought to be produced; only for technical purposes and for their use in medicine. But throughout the world the capitalists produce alcohol with all their might. Why? Because to ply the people with drink is extremely profitable.\033[0m\\n- N.I. Bukharin and E.

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m You know my friends, there comes a time when people get tired of being trampled by the iron feet of oppression. There comes a time my friends, when people get tired of being plunged across the abyss of humiliation, where they experience the bleakness of nagging despair. There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glittering sunlight of life’s July and left standing amid the piercing chill of an alpine November. There comes a time.\033[0m\\n- Martin Luther King Jr., Montgomery Bus Boycott speech, at Holt Street Baptist Church (5 December 1955)\n

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m Oppressed people deal with their oppression in three characteristic ways. One way is acquiescence: the oppressed resign themselves to their doom.

\033[38;2;59;66;97m┃\033[0m\033[38;2;86;95;137m There is such a thing as the freedom of exhaustion. Some people are so worn down by the yoke of oppression that they give up. A few years ago in the slum areas of Atlanta, a Negro guitarist used to sing almost daily: \"Been down so long that down don’t bother me.\" This is the type of negative freedom and resignation that often engulfs the life of the oppressed.\033[0m\\n- Martin Luther King Jr.\n

A few thousands at the outside, who are lost in the midst of hundreds of millions still steeped in prejudices and superstitions worthy of savages, who are consequently ever ready to serve as puppets for religious impostors.\033[0m\\n- Peter Kropotkin\n

We’re stood up and said we’re not going to fight reactionary pigs and reactionary state’s attorneys like this and reactionary state’s attorneys like Hanrahan with any other reactions on our part. We’re going to fight their reactions with all of us people getting together and having an international proletarian revolution.\033[0m\\n- Fred Hampton\n
